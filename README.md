# PhishingInvestigation

This notebook contains an investigation of a dataset containing the features of more than 70k links, as well as whether or not they were phishing attcaks. The data comes from Meneley. The data is first cleaned and organized. Various classifiers are tested preliminarily, after which the two best performing (KNN and RFC) are proceded with for parameter tuning. The optimized models are then validated with cross validiation and confusion heatmapping. Finally, some EDA is performed for further visualization of the data. Note: Sklearn is version specific for this program (likely needs to be downgraded)s
